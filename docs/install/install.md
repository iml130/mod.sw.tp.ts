The TaskSupervisor relies now on few Python packages. These are listed as below:

```
flask
requests
transitions
enum34
jinja2
jsonschema
networkx
matplotlib
fiwareobjectconverter==0.1.1
lotlan-scheduler
sqlalchemy
```

In addition to that it also requires at the moment a ROS1 which includes rospy.
