# TransportOrderGoodsPallet Parallel Example

In this example two Tasks which are independent from each other are definied, so they can run in parallel.

```text
Location pickupItem
    name = "Tag10"
    type = "pallet"
End

Location dropoffItem
    name = "Tag12"
    type = "pallet"
End

Event agvLoadedAtPickupItem
    name = "realSensorAgvLoadedWs1"
    type = "Boolean"
End

Event agvLoadedAtDropoffItem
    name = "realSensorAgvUnloadedWs2"
    type = "Boolean"
End

TransportOrderStep loadPickupItem
    Location pickupItem
    FinishedBy agvLoadedAtPickupItem == True 
End

TransportOrderStep unloadDropoffItem
    Location dropoffItem
    FinishedBy agvLoadedAtDropoffItem == True
End

Task transportGoodsPallet
    Transport
    From loadPickupItem
    To unloadDropoffItem
End

Task transportGoodsPallet2
    Transport
    From loadPickupItem
    To unloadDropoffItem 
End
```
